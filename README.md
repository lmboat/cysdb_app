# CysDB: A Human Cysteine Database based on Experimental Quantitative Chemoproteomics

Cysteine chemoproteomics studies provide proteome-wide portraits of the ligandability or potential ‘druggability’ of thousands of cysteine residues. CysDB is a SQL relational database that is publicly available at https://backuslab.shinyapps.io/cysdb/ and features chemoproteomic measures of identification, hyperreactivity, and ligandability for 62,888 cysteines (24% of all cysteines the human proteome). The CysDB web application also includes annotations of functionality (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, Pfam, Panther), known druggability (FDA approved targets, DrugBank, ChEMBL), disease-relevance and genetic variation (ClinVar, Cancer Gene Census, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), and structural features (Protein Data Bank). We have designed CysDB for the incorporation of new datasets and features to support the continued growth of the druggable cysteineome.
